PROJECT SPECIFICATION:

The goal of this homework is to become familiar with concurrent processing in Linux using shared memory. You will use multiple concurrent processes to write into a ﬁle at random times, solving the concurrency issues using the Bakery algorithm for synchronization of processes. Your job is to create the environment such that two processes cannot write into the ﬁle simultaneously and yet, every process gets its turn to write into the ﬁle.


Generate twenty processes using a master program, called master, and make them write into a ﬁle called cstest in their current working directory. Needless to say that all processes will use the same working directory. Each child process will be executed by an executable called slave. The message to be written into the ﬁle is:
 HH:MM:SS Queue nn File modified by process number xx
where HH:MM:SS is the current system time, nn is the number the process picked when it entered its intention to write into the ﬁle, xx is the process number as speciﬁed by the master program. The value of xx is between 1 and 20. This implies that the child process will be run by the command
slave xx
The critical resource is the ﬁle cstest which should be updated by a child under exclusive control access. This implies that each slave will have a critical section that will control access to the ﬁle to write into 


The code for each slave should use the following template:
for ( i = 0; i < 5; i++ )
{
    	execute code to enter critical section;
	sleep for random amount of time (between 0 and 5 seconds); 
	critical_section();
	sleep for random amount of time (between 0 and 5 seconds); 
	execute code to exit 	from critical section;
}


For this project, I did the following files:
Master.cpp
Slave.cpp
Makefile
README

You must first create the executable program if trying to use this code. Use the 'make' command to create the 'master' executable.

You must implement at least the following command line arguments:
-h 
For help
-s n
Which n is the number of  n slave processes at a time. 
-t ss
 Which ss is the maximum time in seconds after which the process should terminate itself if not completed
-l filename
Filename is the log file use( default output.out)
-i y
Which y determines how many times each slave should increment and write to the file before terminating
